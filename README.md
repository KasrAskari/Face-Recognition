# Face Recognition

## Overview  
This project implements **face recognition** using Python and OpenCV. It aims to detect and recognize human faces in real time or from static images with high accuracy. The system is versatile and can be adapted for applications such as security, access control, and attendance management.

## Features  
- **Face Detection**: Identifies human faces in images or video streams.  
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Processes video streams to recognize faces in real time.  
- **Custom Dataset**: Supports creating and training with custom face datasets.  
- **Integration-Ready**: Can be integrated into larger applications such as access control or monitoring systems.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.  
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and computer vision tasks.  
- **Dlib/DeepFace (if applicable)**: Enhances facial recognition accuracy (if used).
