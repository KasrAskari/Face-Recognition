# Face Recognition

## Overview  
This project implements **face recognition** using Python and OpenCV. It detects and recognizes human faces in real-time or from static images. The system can be adapted for applications such as security, monitoring, and access control.

## Features  
- **Face Detection**: Identifies human faces in images or video streams.  
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Processes video streams to recognize faces.  
- **Custom Dataset**: Supports creating and training with custom datasets.  
- **Integration-Ready**: Easily integrates into larger systems.
